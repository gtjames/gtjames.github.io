["In the famous scene where the \"Marseillaise\" is sung over the
German song \"Watch on the Rhine\", many of the extras had real tears in their eyes; a large
number of them were actual refugees from Nazi persecution in Germany and
elsewhere in Europe and were overcome by the emotions the scene brought
out.", "Back in the early-to-mid 2000s, Madonna wanted to remake \"Casablanca (1942)\" with her playing IIsa
Lund and Ashton Kutcher in the role of Rick Blaine. Madonna pitched the idea to
every studio but was unanimously rejected by every studio with one studio
executive telling her \"That film is deemed untouchable\". The project has
since been scrapped by Madonna.",
"Many of the actors who played the Nazis
were in fact German Jews who had escaped from Nazi Germany.", "In the 1980s,
this film's script was sent to readers at a number of major studios and
production companies under its original title, \"Everybody Comes to
Rick's\".
Some readers recognized the script but most did not. Many complained that the
script was \"not good enough\" to make a decent movie. Others gave such complaints as \"too dated\", \"too much dialog\" and \"not enough sex\".", "Because the film
was made during WWII they were not allowed to film at an airport after dark for
security reasons. Instead they used a sound stage with a small cardboard cutout
airplane and forced perspective. To give the illusion that the plane was
full-sized, they used little people to portray the crew preparing the plane for
take-off. Years later the same technique was used in the film Alien (1979),
with director Ridley Scott's son and some of his friends in scaled down
spacesuits.", "Rick's Cafe was one of the few original sets built for the
film, the rest were all recycled from other Warner Brothers productions due to
wartime restrictions on building supplies.", "When this film
won the Academy Award for Best Picture, Jack L. Warner was first on stage to
accept the award, beating the film's actual producer, Hal B. Wallis, who was
incensed at this slight and never forgave Warner. Wallis, at the time regarded
as the \"wunderkind\" at the studio, left Warner Brothers shortly afterwards.", "Humphrey Bogart
had to wear platform shoes to play alongside Ingrid Bergman and compensate for
the height disparity.", "Ingrid Bergman's line \"Victor Laszlo is my husband, and was, even when I knew you in
Paris\"
was almost cut from the film because during that time it was deemed
inappropriate for a film to depict or suggest a woman romancing with another
man if she were already married. However, it was pointed out that later in the
film she explains that she had thought Laszlo was dead at the time, and the
censors allowed the line to stay in.",
"Some years ago in a shop dealing with
historic documents, a photo still from Casablanca (1942) was found, showing
Rick sitting at the chess board. Accompanying the photo was a letter from
Humphrey Bogart to a friend in New York, indicating a specific chess move. The
document dealer explained that the chess game in the movie was a real game
Bogart was playing by mail with his friend during the course of filming.", "The letters of
transit that motivate so many characters in the film did not exist in
Vichy-controlled France - they are purely a plot device invented by the
screenwriters. Playwright Joan Alison always expected somebody to challenge her
about the letters, but nobody ever did.", "Humphrey
Bogart's wife Mayo Methot continually accused him of having an affair with
Ingrid Bergman, often confronting him in his dressing room before a shot.
Bogart would come onto the set in a rage. In fact, despite the undeniable
on-screen chemistry between Bogart and Bergman, they hardly spoke, and the only
time they bonded was when the two had lunch with Geraldine Fitzgerald.
According to Fitzgerald, \"the whole subject at lunch was how they could get out of that
movie. They thought the dialogue was ridiculous and the situations were unbelievable...
I knew Bogart very well, and I think he wanted to join forces with Bergman, to
make sure they both said the same things.\" For whatever reasons, Bogart and Bergman rarely spoke after
that.", "Conrad Veidt, who played Maj. Strasser, was well known in
the theatrical community in Germany for his hatred of the Nazis, and his
friendship with Jews (including his Jewish wife), and in fact was forced to
hurriedly escape the country when he found out that the SS had sent a death
squad after him because of his anti-Nazi activities. Veidt had it in his
contract that he only played villains because he was convinced that playing
suave Nazi baddies would help the war effort.", "To maximize
profits from foreign distribution of the film, the studio suggested that any
unpleasant characters other than the Nazis should also be from an enemy
country, namely Italy. This is why Ugarte, Ferrari, and the dark European
pickpocket are Italian.", "Early in the production, studio head Jack L. Warner
offered the role of Rick Blaine to George Raft, but the actor turned it down.
As the shooting script took shape, producer Hal B. Wallis began to envision
actor Humphrey Bogart in the Rick Blaine role. As Bogart was under contract to
Warner Bros. the role was assigned to him by Wallis. But after Bogart had been
cast in the role, George Raft reconsidered his decision and contacted Warner to
deliver the news that he had decided to accept the 'Casablanca' part after all.
After consulting with Wallis - who had never envisioned anyone but Bogart in
the role - Warner decided to support his producer: Warner explained to Raft
that Humphrey Bogart had been cast in the role of Rick Blaine, and that the
part was no longer available. Ironically, this was the third of three key roles
Raft turned down that Bogart took on, the other two roles being Roy \"Mad Dog\" Earle in High Sierra
(1941), and Sam Spade in The Maltese Falcon (1941). All three roles would play
significance to establishing Bogart's legendary career.", "Although this
was an overtly anti-Nazi film, it wasn't the first one that Warner Bros. had
made (it had come out several years earlier with Confessions of a Nazi Spy
(1939)). Warners was the first Hollywood studio to be so open about its
opposition to the Nazi regime, and the first to prohibit its films from being
distributed in Nazi-occupied territories. Indeed, Harry M. Warner was making
speeches denouncing Nazi activities in Germany as early as 1936.", "On December 7th
1941, Japan attacked Pearl Harbor and the United States entered the Second
World War. The next day a Warner Brothers reader began to evaluate the
unproduced play \"Everybody Comes To Rick's\" as a possible movie. It was perfect timing as studios raced to
get patriotic pictures into production. Two weeks later, Warners' executive in
charge of production, Hal B. Wallis, decided to make the film, changed the
title to mirror the exotic romanticism of the studio's hit Algiers, and
announced it as a done deal before contracts were signed (Writers Murray
Burnett and Joan Alison received a record $20,000 for the rights to an
unproduced play).", "Director Michael Curtiz' Hungarian accent often caused
confusion on the set. He asked a prop man for a \"poodle\" to appear in one
scene. The prop man searched high and low for a poodle while the entire crew
waited. He found one and presented it to Curtiz, who screamed \"A poodle! A poodle of
water!\"
See also The Charge of the Light Brigade (1936).", "It is never
revealed why Rick cannot return to America. Julius J. Epstein later said that \"My brother (Philip G.
Epstein) and I tried very hard to come up with a reason why Rick couldn't
return to America. But nothing seemed right. We finally decided not to give a
reason at all.\"", "Dooley Wilson (Sam) was a professional drummer who faked playing
the piano. As the music was recorded at the same time as the film, the piano
playing was actually a recording of a performance by Elliot Carpenter who was
playing behind a curtain but who was positioned such that Dooley could watch,
and copy, his hand movements.",
"During the shoot, Humphrey Bogart was
called to the studio to stand in the middle of the Rick's Cafe set and nod. He
had no idea what the nod meant in the story - that he was giving his O.K. for
the band in the cafe to play the \"Marseillaise.\"", "\"As Time Goes By\" was written by lifelong bachelor Herman Hupfeld and debuted in
1931's Broadway show \"Everybody's Welcome\", sung by Frances Williams, It had been a personal favorite of
playwright and high school teacher Murray Burnett who, seven years later,
visited Vienna just after the Nazis had entered. Later, after visiting a café
in south France where a black pianist had entertained a mixed crowd of Nazis,
French and refugees, Burnett was inspired to write the melodrama \"Everybody Comes to
Rick's\",
which was optioned for production by Martin Gabel and Carly Wharton, and later,
Warners. After the film's release, \"As Time Goes By\" stayed on radio's \"Hit Parade\" for 21 weeks. However, because of the coincidental musicians'
union recording ban, the 1931 Rudy Vallee version became the smash hit. (It
contains the rarely-sung introductory verse, not heard in the film.) Max
Steiner, in a 1943 interview, admitted that the song \"must have had
something to attract so much attention\".", "Captain Renault's line, \"You like war. I like
women,\"
was changed from \"You enjoy war. I enjoy women,\" in order to meet decency standards.", "Film debut of
Joy Page, stepdaughter of studio head Jack L. Warner. She played the young
Bulgarian wife. She, Humphrey Bogart and Dooley Wilson were the only
American-born people in the credited cast.", "A $100,000
insurance policy was taken out on the films leading player, Humphrey Bogart, in
case he died during the film's production.", "Ingrid Bergman's
contract was owned by producer David O. Selznick, and producer Hal B. Wallis
sent the film's writers, Philip G. Epstein and Julius J. Epstein, to persuade
Selznick to loan her to Warner Bros. for the picture. After 20 minutes of
describing the plot to Selznick, Julius gave up and said, \"Oh, what the hell!
It's a lot of shit like Algiers (1938)!\" Selznick nodded and agreed to the loan.", "Dooley Wilson
was, in fact, the only member of the cast to have ever actually visited the
city of Casablanca.", "Sam's piano sold for more than $600,000 (£370,000) at a
New York auction in December 2012.",
"Rick never says \"Play it again, Sam.\" He says: \"You played it for her,
you can play it for me. If she can take it, I can take it so Play it!\". Ilsa says \"Play it, Sam. Play 'As
Time Goes By\"'. The incorrect line has become the basis for spoofs in movies
such as A Night in Casablanca (1946) and Play It Again, Sam (1972).", "Reportedly, many
of the shadows were painted onto the set.", "Madeleine
Lebeau, who plays Yvonne, and Marcel Dalio, who plays croupier Emil, were
husband and wife at the time of filming. They had not long before escaped the
Nazis by fleeing their native France.",
"The difference in height between
Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman changes throughout the film. This is because
Bergman was actually a few inches taller than Bogart, though to create the
illusion that it was vice versa, Michael Curtiz had Bogart stand on boxes and
sit on pillows in some shots, or had Bergman slouch down (as evident when she
sits on the couch in the \"franc for your thoughts\" scene).", "Michèle Morgan asked for $55,000, but Hal B. Wallis
refused to pay it when he could get Ingrid Bergman for $25,000.", "Sydney
Greenstreet wanted to wear something more ethnic to show that his character had
assimilated into the Moroccan lifestyle. This idea was nixed by producer Hal B.
Wallis who insisted that he wear his now-iconic white suit.", "Warner Brothers
claimed that people of 34 nationalities worked on the film.", "At the beginning
of the film, the spinning globe shows the extent of three empires during the
Second World War. The German 'Third Reich' in Europe, the 'Great Japanese
Empire' in South-East Asia and the British Empire in Africa and South Asia
(notably modern-day India and Pakistan).", "Was named the
best screenplay of all time by the Writers Guild of America (2006)", "\"Here's looking at you,
kid\"
was improvised by Humphrey Bogart in the Parisian scenes and worked so well
that it was used later on again in the film. He originally used the same line
in Midnight (1934). It is also rumored that during breaks, Ingrid Bergman would
play poker with other cast members. Since she was still learning English,
Bogart would occasionally watch the game, and he added \"Here's looking at you\" to her poker
repertoire.", "The influx into Hollywood of large numbers of European
exiles fleeing the war helped the casting enormously. In fact, of all the
featured players in the film who get screen credit, only three were born in the
United States: Humphrey Bogart, Dooley Wilson and Joy Page.", "Casey Robinson,
who re-wrote the romantic scenes between Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman,
was offered screen credit but turned it down because at the time he was only
taking credit for scripts he wrote entirely by himself. By declining credit, he
did himself out of an Academy Award.",
"\"Rick's Café Américain\" was modeled after Hotel El Minzah in Tangiers.", "The movie's line
\"Here's
looking at you, kid\" was voted as the #5 movie quote by the American Film Institute,
and as #1 of \"The 100 Greatest Movie Lines\" by Premiere in 2007.",
"After shooting, Max Steiner spoke
against using \"As Time Goes By\" as the song identifying Rick and Ilsa, saying he would rather
compose an original song in order to qualify for royalties. However, Hal B.
Wallis replied that since the filming had ended, Ingrid Bergman had cut her
hair very short for For Whom the Bell Tolls (1943) which was shooting at a
distant locale and she therefore could not re-shoot already-completed scenes that
had used \"As Time Goes By\".", "The iconic \"La Marsaillaise\" sequence was intended to been even more pointed against the
Nazis. The original song Major Strasser and the other Germans were to sing was
not \"Die
Wacht am Rhein\", a patriotic song written in 1840 and extensively used in the
Franco-German War and in World War I, but instead \"Das Horst-Wessel-Lied\", the Nazi Party
anthem and unofficial second national anthem of Nazi Germany. However, Warner
Bros. changed it when they realized that the song was under copyright, which
wouldn't have been a problem if the film were only being distributed in Allied
territory. However as the film was also going to be released in neutral
countries as well, it could have caused major diplomatic headaches and even
opened Warner Bros. to the absurd possibility of being sued by the Nazis for
copyright infringement. Or having to pay them royalties.", "In 2007, the
American Film Institute ranked this as the #3 Greatest Movie of All Time.", "Warner Bros. had
intended to use the \"Horst-Wessel-Lied\", the anthem of the Nazi party, during the \"battle of the anthems\" sequence, but the
copyright was controlled by a German company, and Warners dropped that anthem
for the 1840s song \"Die Wacht Am Rhein\" (about a vow to defend the Rhineland from a French invasion)
rather than violate the rights (which would have prompted the German copyright
holder on the song to prohibit the movie from being shown in any country not at
war with Germany).", "The film cost approximately $950,000, some $100,000 over
budget.", "Warner Brothers purchased the play for $20,000, the most
anyone had ever paid for an unproduced work.", "At a salary of
$25,000 for five weeks' work, Conrad Veidt was the highest-paid actor on the
set and on loan from MGM. His main competition for the Major Strasser role was
Otto Preminger, under contract to 20th Century-Fox, for whom Darryl F. Zanuck
had demanded the outrageous sum of $7,000 per week.", "The first shot
of Rick sees him playing chess, a personal favorite game of Humphrey
Bogart's.", "The dialogue spoken by Carl when he is serving the German
couple seeking to immigrate to America translates as: \"I am here already, Mr.
Leuchtag. I have brought the finest cognac. The drink that is otherwise only
for the employees.\"", "Producer Hal B. Wallis nearly made the character Sam a
female. Hazel Scott, Lena Horne, and Ella Fitzgerald were considered for the
role.", "Paul Henreid was loaned to Warners for the role of Victor
Lazlo by Selznick International Pictures against his will. He was concerned
that playing a secondary character would ruin his career as a romantic
lead.", "In the original script for Casablanca (1942), then titled \"Everyone Come to
Rick's\",
Ilsa was not a 'virtuous' woman. She was living with an already married
American business man. It was Rick who left her when he found out. And when she
and Victor come to Casablanca, she is not married to him, either.", "The film's

similar gesture of defiance. In La Grande Illusion (1937) the song was led by a

into some trouble with Joseph Breen of the Production Code Administration (the
Hollywood self-censorship body), who opposed the suggestions that Captain
Renault extorted sexual favours from his supplicants, and that Rick and Ilsa
had slept together in Paris. Extensive changes were made, with several lines of
dialogue removed or altered. All direct references to sex were deleted;
Renault's selling of visas for sex, and Rick and Ilsa's previous sexual
relationship were implied elliptically rather than referenced explicitly. Also,
in the original script, when Sam plays \"As Time Goes By\", Rick remarks, \"What the - are you playing?\" This line implying a curse word was removed at the behest of
the Hays Office.", "Rick and Ilsa standing over Sam's piano in Paris was the
first scene to be shot. Filming a tender love scene with two actors who had
just met was not planned, but the filming of Now, Voyager (1942) had gone over

wanted to appear in the film. Bergman thought the material little more than
fluff, whereas the role in For Whom the Bell Tolls (1943), one she desperately
wanted to do, would do wonders for her career. Once the wrap date for
Casablanca approached, Bergman realized happily that she would be able to film
the Hemingway story after all. For his part, Paul Henreid had just starred with

Ronald Reagan and Ann Sheridan were scheduled to appear in this film, and
Dennis Morgan is mentioned as the third lead. This was never the case, however,

for the three other actors, to keep their names in the press. Meanwhile George
Raft was angling for the part with Jack L. Warner, but Hal B. Wallis had been
assigned to search for what would be Humphrey Bogart's next starring role. He
