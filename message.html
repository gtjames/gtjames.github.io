        This month I spoke about our relationship and what we can do for each other.
        There are some things only a Bishop can do. But the other half of the relationship,
        what you can do for the ward, is much bigger. C. S. Lewis said it well:
    </div>
    <div>
        “Christ says "Give me All. I don't want so much of your time and so much of your money and so much of your
        work: I want You. I have not come to torment your natural self, but to kill it. No half-measures are any
        good. I don't want to cut off a branch here and a branch there, I want to have the whole tree down.
        Hand over the whole natural self, all the desires which you think innocent as well as the ones you
        think wicked—the whole outfit. I will give you a new self instead. In fact, I will give you Myself:
        my own will shall become yours." (C. S. Lewis, Mere Christianity)
    </div>
    <div>
        That’s right. I need you! The whole you. Not just the part that shows up on Sunday.
        <ul>
            <li>I need all of you.</li>
            <li>I need your arms to reach out to the quiet ones in the ward.</li>
            <li>I need your feet to run to those in need.</li>
            <li>I need your minds to interpret the gospel principles to those still learning.</li>
            <li>I need your hearts to be compassionate.</li>
            <li>I need your ears, because everyone in this ward needs a friend and a listening ear (even you do. I know that).</li>
            <li>I need your shoulders to carry the burdens others currently can’t lift.</li>
            <li>I need your spirit to discern when someone needs you.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        Finally, from our prophet, Pres. Nelson
        “The question for each of us … is the same. Are you willing to let God be the most important influence in
        your life? Will you allow His words, His commandments, and His covenants to influence what you do each day?
        Will you allow His voice to take priority over any other? Are you willing to let whatever He needs you to do
        take precedence over every other ambition? Are you willing to have your will swallowed up in His?”
        (Pres. Nelson, Let God Prevail, Oct 2020)

        We have all made covenants. Let’s know keep them together and do all we can to bless each other’s lives.

        Merry Christmas!
