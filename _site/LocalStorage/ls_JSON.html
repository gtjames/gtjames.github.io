<title>A little demonstation on Local Storage</title>
</head>
<body>
I am not going to spend anytime on the user interface. This is not a demonstration on UI<p><p><p>
All of the interesting stuff is in the HTM. I create three 'identical' objects. Two JSON using two differnet methods and a long String object<BR>
Then I put them all into local storage. Take a look at the LocalStorage and you will see that the strings are identical even though they were created three different ways and then stringified and put in LS<BR>
Finally I extract the strings and pop them into the page to compare. They are the same except for some extra white space.<BR>
What I want you to see is how you can take an object put it in to LS, retrieve it, convert into an object and then use<BR><BR><BR>
    
classData	<div style="color:blue;" id="classData">classData</div><p>
