          "In the famous scene where the \"Marseillaise\" is sung over the German song \"Watch on the Rhine\", many of the extras had real tears in their eyes; a large number of them were actual refugees from Nazi persecution in Germany and elsewhere in Europe and were overcome by the emotions the scene brought out.",
          "Back in the early-to-mid 2000s, Madonna wanted to remake \"Casablanca (1942)\" with her playing IIsa Lund and Ashton Kutcher in the role of Rick Blaine. Madonna pitched the idea to every studio but was unanimously rejected by every studio with one studio executive telling her \"That film is deemed untouchable\". The project has since been scrapped by Madonna.",
          "Many of the actors who played the Nazis were in fact German Jews who had escaped from Nazi Germany.",
          "In the 1980s, this film's script was sent to readers at a number of major studios and production companies under its original title, \"Everybody Comes to Rick's\". Some readers recognized the script but most did not. Many complained that the script was \"not good enough\" to make a decent movie. Others gave such complaints as \"too dated\", \"too much dialog\" and \"not enough sex\".",
          "Because the film was made during WWII they were not allowed to film at an airport after dark for security reasons. Instead they used a sound stage with a small cardboard cutout airplane and forced perspective. To give the illusion that the plane was full-sized, they used little people to portray the crew preparing the plane for take-off. Years later the same technique was used in the film Alien (1979), with director Ridley Scott's son and some of his friends in scaled down spacesuits.",
          "Rick's Cafe was one of the few original sets built for the film, the rest were all recycled from other Warner Brothers productions due to wartime restrictions on building supplies.",
          "When this film won the Academy Award for Best Picture, Jack L. Warner was first on stage to accept the award, beating the film's actual producer, Hal B. Wallis, who was incensed at this slight and never forgave Warner. Wallis, at the time regarded as the \"wunderkind\" at the studio, left Warner Brothers shortly afterwards.",
          "Humphrey Bogart had to wear platform shoes to play alongside Ingrid Bergman and compensate for the height disparity.",
          "Ingrid Bergman's line \"Victor Laszlo is my husband, and was, even when I knew you in Paris\" was almost cut from the film because during that time it was deemed inappropriate for a film to depict or suggest a woman romancing with another man if she were already married. However, it was pointed out that later in the film she explains that she had thought Laszlo was dead at the time, and the censors allowed the line to stay in.",
          "Some years ago in a shop dealing with historic documents, a photo still from Casablanca (1942) was found, showing Rick sitting at the chess board. Accompanying the photo was a letter from Humphrey Bogart to a friend in New York, indicating a specific chess move. The document dealer explained that the chess game in the movie was a real game Bogart was playing by mail with his friend during the course of filming.",
          "The letters of transit that motivate so many characters in the film did not exist in Vichy-controlled France - they are purely a plot device invented by the screenwriters. Playwright Joan Alison always expected somebody to challenge her about the letters, but nobody ever did.",
          "Humphrey Bogart's wife Mayo Methot continually accused him of having an affair with Ingrid Bergman, often confronting him in his dressing room before a shot. Bogart would come onto the set in a rage. In fact, despite the undeniable on-screen chemistry between Bogart and Bergman, they hardly spoke, and the only time they bonded was when the two had lunch with Geraldine Fitzgerald. According to Fitzgerald, \"the whole subject at lunch was how they could get out of that movie. They thought the dialogue was ridiculous and the situations were unbelievable... I knew Bogart very well, and I think he wanted to join forces with Bergman, to make sure they both said the same things.\" For whatever reasons, Bogart and Bergman rarely spoke after that.",
          "Conrad Veidt, who played Maj. Strasser, was well known in the theatrical community in Germany for his hatred of the Nazis, and his friendship with Jews (including his Jewish wife), and in fact was forced to hurriedly escape the country when he found out that the SS had sent a death squad after him because of his anti-Nazi activities. Veidt had it in his contract that he only played villains because he was convinced that playing suave Nazi baddies would help the war effort.",
          "To maximize profits from foreign distribution of the film, the studio suggested that any unpleasant characters other than the Nazis should also be from an enemy country, namely Italy. This is why Ugarte, Ferrari, and the dark European pickpocket are Italian.",
          "Early in the production, studio head Jack L. Warner offered the role of Rick Blaine to George Raft, but the actor turned it down. As the shooting script took shape, producer Hal B. Wallis began to envision actor Humphrey Bogart in the Rick Blaine role. As Bogart was under contract to Warner Bros. the role was assigned to him by Wallis. But after Bogart had been cast in the role, George Raft reconsidered his decision and contacted Warner to deliver the news that he had decided to accept the 'Casablanca' part after all. After consulting with Wallis - who had never envisioned anyone but Bogart in the role - Warner decided to support his producer: Warner explained to Raft that Humphrey Bogart had been cast in the role of Rick Blaine, and that the part was no longer available. Ironically, this was the third of three key roles Raft turned down that Bogart took on, the other two roles being Roy \"Mad Dog\" Earle in High Sierra (1941), and Sam Spade in The Maltese Falcon (1941). All three roles would play significance to establishing Bogart's legendary career.",
          "Although this was an overtly anti-Nazi film, it wasn't the first one that Warner Bros. had made (it had come out several years earlier with Confessions of a Nazi Spy (1939)). Warners was the first Hollywood studio to be so open about its opposition to the Nazi regime, and the first to prohibit its films from being distributed in Nazi-occupied territories. Indeed, Harry M. Warner was making speeches denouncing Nazi activities in Germany as early as 1936.",
          "On December 7th 1941, Japan attacked Pearl Harbor and the United States entered the Second World War. The next day a Warner Brothers reader began to evaluate the unproduced play \"Everybody Comes To Rick's\" as a possible movie. It was perfect timing as studios raced to get patriotic pictures into production. Two weeks later, Warners' executive in charge of production, Hal B. Wallis, decided to make the film, changed the title to mirror the exotic romanticism of the studio's hit Algiers, and announced it as a done deal before contracts were signed (Writers Murray Burnett and Joan Alison received a record $20,000 for the rights to an unproduced play).",
          "Director Michael Curtiz' Hungarian accent often caused confusion on the set. He asked a prop man for a \"poodle\" to appear in one scene. The prop man searched high and low for a poodle while the entire crew waited. He found one and presented it to Curtiz, who screamed \"A poodle! A poodle of water!\" See also The Charge of the Light Brigade (1936).",
          "It is never revealed why Rick cannot return to America. Julius J. Epstein later said that \"My brother (Philip G. Epstein) and I tried very hard to come up with a reason why Rick couldn't return to America. But nothing seemed right. We finally decided not to give a reason at all.\"",
          "Dooley Wilson (Sam) was a professional drummer who faked playing the piano. As the music was recorded at the same time as the film, the piano playing was actually a recording of a performance by Elliot Carpenter who was playing behind a curtain but who was positioned such that Dooley could watch, and copy, his hand movements.",
          "During the shoot, Humphrey Bogart was called to the studio to stand in the middle of the Rick's Cafe set and nod. He had no idea what the nod meant in the story - that he was giving his O.K. for the band in the cafe to play the \"Marseillaise.\"",
          "\"As Time Goes By\" was written by lifelong bachelor Herman Hupfeld and debuted in 1931's Broadway show \"Everybody's Welcome\", sung by Frances Williams, It had been a personal favorite of playwright and high school teacher Murray Burnett who, seven years later, visited Vienna just after the Nazis had entered. Later, after visiting a café in south France where a black pianist had entertained a mixed crowd of Nazis, French and refugees, Burnett was inspired to write the melodrama \"Everybody Comes to Rick's\", which was optioned for production by Martin Gabel and Carly Wharton, and later, Warners. After the film's release, \"As Time Goes By\" stayed on radio's \"Hit Parade\" for 21 weeks. However, because of the coincidental musicians' union recording ban, the 1931 Rudy Vallee version became the smash hit. (It contains the rarely-sung introductory verse, not heard in the film.) Max Steiner, in a 1943 interview, admitted that the song \"must have had something to attract so much attention\".",
          "Captain Renault's line, \"You like war. I like women,\" was changed from \"You enjoy war. I enjoy women,\" in order to meet decency standards.",
          "Film debut of Joy Page, stepdaughter of studio head Jack L. Warner. She played the young Bulgarian wife. She, Humphrey Bogart and Dooley Wilson were the only American-born people in the credited cast.",
          "A $100,000 insurance policy was taken out on the films leading player, Humphrey Bogart, in case he died during the film's production.",
          "Ingrid Bergman's contract was owned by producer David O. Selznick, and producer Hal B. Wallis sent the film's writers, Philip G. Epstein and Julius J. Epstein, to persuade Selznick to loan her to Warner Bros. for the picture. After 20 minutes of describing the plot to Selznick, Julius gave up and said, \"Oh, what the hell! It's a lot of shit like Algiers (1938)!\" Selznick nodded and agreed to the loan.",
          "Dooley Wilson was, in fact, the only member of the cast to have ever actually visited the city of Casablanca.",
          "Sam's piano sold for more than $600,000 (£370,000) at a New York auction in December 2012.",
          "Rick never says \"Play it again, Sam.\" He says: \"You played it for her, you can play it for me. If she can take it, I can take it so Play it!\". Ilsa says \"Play it, Sam. Play 'As Time Goes By\"'. The incorrect line has become the basis for spoofs in movies such as A Night in Casablanca (1946) and Play It Again, Sam (1972).",
          "Reportedly, many of the shadows were painted onto the set.",
          "Madeleine Lebeau, who plays Yvonne, and Marcel Dalio, who plays croupier Emil, were husband and wife at the time of filming. They had not long before escaped the Nazis by fleeing their native France.",
          "The difference in height between Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman changes throughout the film. This is because Bergman was actually a few inches taller than Bogart, though to create the illusion that it was vice versa, Michael Curtiz had Bogart stand on boxes and sit on pillows in some shots, or had Bergman slouch down (as evident when she sits on the couch in the \"franc for your thoughts\" scene).",
          "Michèle Morgan asked for $55,000, but Hal B. Wallis refused to pay it when he could get Ingrid Bergman for $25,000.",
          "Sydney Greenstreet wanted to wear something more ethnic to show that his character had assimilated into the Moroccan lifestyle. This idea was nixed by producer Hal B. Wallis who insisted that he wear his now-iconic white suit.",
          "Warner Brothers claimed that people of 34 nationalities worked on the film.",
          "At the beginning of the film, the spinning globe shows the extent of three empires during the Second World War. The German 'Third Reich' in Europe, the 'Great Japanese Empire' in South-East Asia and the British Empire in Africa and South Asia (notably modern-day India and Pakistan).",
          "Was named the best screenplay of all time by the Writers Guild of America (2006)",
          "\"Here's looking at you, kid\" was improvised by Humphrey Bogart in the Parisian scenes and worked so well that it was used later on again in the film.

However, Warner Bros. changed it when they realized that the song was under copyright, which wouldn't have been a problem if the film were only being distributed in Allied territory.

          "The street used for the exterior shots had recently been built for another film, The Desert Song (1943) and redressed for the Paris flashbacks. It remained on the Warners backlot until the 1960s.",
          "\"La Marseillaise\" was written in 1792 by Claude Joseph Rouget de Lisle in Strasbourg after the declaration of war by France against Austria, and was originally titled \"Chant de guerre pour l'Armée du Rhin\" (\"War Song for the Rhine Army\"). It is used by Laszlo and a group of Rick's patrons to drown out a group of German soldiers singing \"Die Wacht am Rhein\" (\"The Watch on the Rhine\").",
          "Producer Hal Wallis originally wanted Philip Dorn in the role of Victor Laszlo, but he was unavailable.",
          "The German song drowned out by the Marseillaise is \"Die Wacht am Rhein\", whose lyrics mentions the German defeat of a French army. The song was put into use by Germany as a second national anthem after the defeat of the French army in the Franco-Prussian War. It regained popularity as a patriotic tune during WWI and again in WWII, so as the song for the German officers it adds an extra layer of symbolism: It was the soundtrack to three very bloody wars against Germany, and two humiliating defeats for France.",
          "The film is included on Roger Ebert's \"Great Movies\" list.",
          "The quote \"Of all the Gin Joints, in all the towns, in all the world, she walks into mine.\" Inspired the title of the Fall Out Boy song 'Of All the Gin Joints In all the World' from their 2005 album 'From Under the Cork Tree.'",
          "Peter Lorre, the actor who played the character of Ugarte, was born in Austria and had changed his name from László Löwenstein at the beginning of his acting career. László is the name of one of the main characters, Victor Laszlo, played by Paul Henreid.",
          "In 1943, famous comedian Jack Benny parodied the movie on his radio show, with himself as Ricky Bogart, and Eddie 'Rochester' Anderson as Sam. At one point in the sketch, Ricky asks: \"Sam, Sam, play that song for me again, will you?\" This is almost certainly the origin of the \"Play it again, Sam\" myth.",
          "No one knew right up until the filming of the last scene whether Ilsa would end up with Rick or Laszlo. During the course of the picture, when Ingrid Bergman asked director Michael Curtiz with which man her character was in love, she was told to \"play it in between\". Since the ending was not the final scene shot, there are some scenes where she *was* aware of how everything would turn out, and these include the scene in the black market with Rick and the scene in the Blue Parrot where Ferrari offers the Laszlos one exit visa.",
          "The last line is one of the most misquoted lines in all of film history. The correct line is, \"Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.\" It has been quoted as, \"This could be the beginning of a beautiful friendship\" or \"I think this is the start of a beautiful friendship.\" This line was a last-minute addition, thought up by producer Hal B. Wallis and dubbed in by Humphrey Bogart after filming was completed.",
          "Several times the writers discussed having Rick leave with Lois/Ilsa, but this was always rejected (and the censors would not have allowed it with her married to Victor). Their major problem was to make it plausible that despite clearly loving Rick, she would leave with Victor; the final scene was rewritten many times until this was achieved.",
          "When Captain Renault drops the bottle of Vichy water into the trash, he's symbolically rejecting the German-controlled Vichy government of France.",
          "Just before he shot Major Strasser (Conrad Veidt), Humphrey Bogart ad-libbed the line, \"All right, Major, you asked for it.\" But Hal B. Wallis pointed out that this made it look as though when Strasser drew his gun first it was self-defense. Veidt was recalled and the scene reshot without the added line, but the original version was used in the trailer for the movie.",
          "The Allies invaded Casablanca in real life on 8 November 1942. As the film was not due for release until spring, studio executives suggested it be changed to incorporate the invasion. Warner Bros. chief Jack L. Warner objected, as he thought that an invasion was a subject worth a whole film, not just an epilogue, and that the main story of this film demanded a pre-invasion setting. Eventually he gave in, though, and producer Hal B. Wallis prepared to shoot an epilogue where Humphrey Bogart and Claude Rains hear about the invasion. However, before Rains could travel to the studio for this, David O. Selznick (whose studio owned Bergman's contract) previewed the film and urged Warner to release it unaltered and as fast as possible. Warner agreed and the premiered in New York on November 26. It did not play in Los Angeles until its general release the following January, and hence competed against 1943 films for the Oscars.",
          "The movie's line \"Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.\" was voted as the #20 movie quote by the American Film Institute.",
          "Ingrid Bergman considered her left side as her better side, and to the extent possible that was the side photographed throughout the film, so she is almost always on the right side of the screen looking towards the left regardless of who is in the shot with her. However, there are several shots where she is to the left and Humphrey Bogart is on the right, including the flashbacks to the street scene in Paris (0:41:50) and the scene at the window (0:43:40). There are also several scenes where Bergman is centered between Paul Henreid and Bogart, suggesting the triangle nature of their relationship; in these shots Henreid is usually to the left and Bogart is usually on the right, including the scene where she and Henreid enter the café at just before the famous \"Battle of the Anthems\" (1:07:40); the scene where Captain Renault arrests Victor Laszlo (1:34:00); and at the end of the final airport scene (1:39:00).",
          "The movie's line \"Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.\" was voted as the #65 of \"The 100 Greatest Movie Lines\" by Premiere in 2007."

Lisbon became the great embarkation point. But, not everybody could get to Lisbon directly, and so a tortuous, roundabout refugee trail sprang up - Paris to Marseilles... across the Mediterranean to Oran... then by train, or auto, or foot across the rim of Africa, to Casablanca in French Morocco. Here, the fortunate ones through money, or influence, or luck, might obtain exit visas and scurry to Lisbon; and from Lisbon, to the New World. But the others wait in Casablanca... and wait... and wait... and wait.",
